# Heap Sort

This project implements the Heap Sort algorithm in C.

## Description

Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on a binary heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place it at the end. We repeat the same process for the remaining elements.

## Files

- `heap_sort.c` - Implementation of the Heap Sort algorithm.
- `heap_sort.h` - Header file with function prototypes.
- `README.md` - Project documentation.

## Usage

1. Compile the code:
    ```bash
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic heap_sort.c -o heap_sort
    ```
2. Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./heap_sort
    ```
