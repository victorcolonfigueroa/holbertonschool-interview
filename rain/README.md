# Rain

This project contains a solution to the "Rain" interview problem.

## Description

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the heights of bars, the goal is to compute how much water can be trapped after raining.

## Files

- `0-rain.py`: Python script containing the solution.
- `main.py`: Example usage and test cases.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Usage

```bash
python3 0-rain.py
```

## Example

Given the list `[0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the output should be `6`.
