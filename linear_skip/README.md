# Linear Skip List

This project implements a linear skip list data structure in C.

## Description

A linear skip list is a variant of the skip list data structure, optimized for efficient search operations. It allows fast traversal and searching in a sorted singly linked list by skipping over multiple elements.

## Files

- `linear_skip.h`: Header file with structure definitions and function prototypes.
- `linear_skip.c`: Implementation of the linear skip list functions.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Usage

Compile the source files and include the header to use the linear skip list functions in your project.

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic linear_skip.c -o linear_skip
```
