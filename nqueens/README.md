# N-Queens

This project solves the classic N-Queens problem: placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

```bash
python3 0-nqueens.py N
```

- `N` must be an integer ≥ 4.

## Example

```bash
python3 0-nqueens.py 4
```

## Output

Each solution is printed as a list of lists, where each inner list represents the row and column of a queen.
